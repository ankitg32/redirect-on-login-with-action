Idea:
Any action that needs authentication before successful dispatch can be passed as a callback to the login page
    The login page now has this callback in memory, which means as long the page is alive and NOT refreshed, this callback is available to be executed on successful login
     - NOT DOABLE, how do u pass the callback? inside 'state' of the history?? well, it doesn't allow callbacks

This is a simple react app which tries to implement a simple real world scenario:
many web apps allow unauthenticated users to navigate the app in a somewhat read-only mode (think browsing twitter without login). A user might want to perform an action that requires authentication (think liking a tweet). In this case, as soon as the user tries to perform the action, he is redirected to a sign up/login page. Upon successful authentication, the user is redirected back to the original page (page with the tweet) and the action that he was trying to perform (liking the tweet) gets performed automatically. This remembering the action and performing it automatically is a use case I noticed in multiple mature apps and is reasonably good user experience. This is my attempt to implement the same.
